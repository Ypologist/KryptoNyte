**Author:** Manus AI  
**Date:** September 28, 2025  
**Project:** KryptoNyte RISC-V Processor  
**Status:** Infrastructure Complete, Runtime Issues Remaining  

## Executive Summary

This report documents the comprehensive setup and configuration of RISC-V Conformance Framework (RISCOF) testing for the KryptoNyte project's ZeroNyte RV32I core. The project has successfully established a complete testing infrastructure including toolchain installation, RTL enhancement, plugin development, and test environment configuration. While the basic infrastructure is operational, some runtime simulation issues require additional debugging to achieve full conformance test execution.

## Project Overview

The KryptoNyte project implements a family of RISC-V processor cores, with the ZeroNyte core serving as the foundational RV32I implementation. RISCOF provides the standard framework for validating RISC-V processor implementations against the official architectural test suite, ensuring compliance with the RISC-V specification.

## Achievements and Progress

### 1. Development Environment Setup

The project now includes a complete RISC-V development environment with the following components:

| Component | Version | Installation Path | Status |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|---------|
| RISC-V Toolchain | GCC 13.2.0 | `/usr/bin/riscv*-unknown-elf-*` | ✅ Installed |
| RISCOF Framework | 1.25.3 | System-wide via pip | ✅ Installed |
| Conformance Tests | Latest | `/opt/riscv-conformance/` | ✅ Installed |
| Spike Simulator | Latest | `/opt/riscv-conformance/spike/bin/` | ✅ Installed |
| Verilator | 5.030 | `/usr/bin/verilator` | ✅ Installed |
| SBT Build Tool | 1.10.2 | SDKMAN managed | ✅ Installed |
| RTL Tools | Latest | `/opt/oss-cad-suite/bin/` | ✅ Installed |

### 2. RTL Enhancement and Generation

The ZeroNyte core has been significantly enhanced to support conformance testing:

**Original Core Limitations:**
- Hardcoded instruction memory with only 3 instructions
- No external memory interface
- Limited debugging capabilities

**Enhanced Core Features:**
- **External Memory Interface:** Added separate instruction and data memory ports
- **Configurable Memory Access:** Support for external memory loading and access
- **Debug Outputs:** Enhanced visibility into core state and execution
- **Load/Store Support:** Proper handling of memory operations

**RTL Generation Pipeline:**
```
Chisel Source → FIRRTOOL → Yosys → Verilog RTL
```

The enhanced core now generates a complete Verilog implementation with the following interface:

```verilog
module ZeroNyteRV32ICore(
  input         clock,
  input         reset,
  output [31:0] io_imem_addr,    // Instruction memory address
  input  [31:0] io_imem_rdata,   // Instruction memory read data
  output [31:0] io_dmem_addr,    // Data memory address
  input  [31:0] io_dmem_rdata,   // Data memory read data
  output [31:0] io_dmem_wdata,   // Data memory write data
  output        io_dmem_wen,     // Data memory write enable
  output [31:0] io_pc_out,       // Program counter (debug)
  output [31:0] io_instr_out,    // Current instruction (debug)
  output [31:0] io_result        // ALU result (debug)
);
```

### 3. RISCOF Plugin Development

A comprehensive RISCOF plugin has been developed for the ZeroNyte core with the following capabilities:

**Plugin Architecture:**
- **Compilation Pipeline:** RISC-V GCC → ELF → Verilog Hex format
- **Simulation Engine:** Verilator-based RTL simulation
- **Memory Model:** 4MB simulated memory with proper address mapping
- **Signature Extraction:** Automated test result collection

**Key Features:**
- Support for RV32I instruction set
- Configurable memory base address (0x80000000)
- Automatic test compilation and execution
- VCD waveform generation for debugging
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### 4. Test Environment Configuration

The testing environment has been properly configured with:

**Directory Structure:**
```
tests/
├── riscof/
│   ├── config.ini              # RISCOF configuration
│   ├── zeronyte/               # ZeroNyte plugin
│   │   ├── riscof_zeronyte.py  # Main plugin implementation
│   │   ├── zeronyte_isa.yaml   # ISA specification
│   │   ├── zeronyte_platform.yaml # Platform specification

│   └── work/                   # Test execution workspace
└── run_conformance_tests.sh    # Test runner script
```

**Configuration Files:**
- **ISA Specification:** Defines RV32I support with proper extension configuration
- **Platform Specification:** Configures memory layout and test parameters
- **Environment Headers:** Resolved macro conflicts and compilation issues

## Technical Challenges Resolved

### 1. Macro Redefinition Conflicts

**Problem:** Conflicting macro definitions between `arch_test.h` and `model_test.h` caused compilation failures.

**Solution:** Removed duplicate `RVMODEL_IO_CHECK()` macro from local `arch_test.h` while preserving the complete definition in `model_test.h`.

### 2. Spike Plugin Configuration

**Problem:** Empty `sail_config` object caused Spike plugin initialization failures.

**Solution:** Created proper `sail_config.json` with minimal but valid configuration:
```json
{
  "reset_vector": "0x80000000",
  "enable_commitlog": false,
  "enable_histogram": false
}
```

### 3. Toolchain Compatibility

**Problem:** Downloaded RISC-V toolchain had GLIBC version incompatibilities.

**Solution:** Switched to Ubuntu repository-provided toolchain with proper symlinks for 32-bit tools.

### 4. RTL Memory Interface

**Problem:** Original core lacked external memory interface required for test execution.

**Solution:** Enhanced Chisel source code to add proper instruction and data memory interfaces with configurable addressing.

## Current Status and Remaining Issues

### Working Components ✅

1. **Complete toolchain installation and configuration**
2. **RTL generation pipeline with enhanced memory interface**
3. **RISCOF plugin with compilation and simulation capabilities**
4. **Test environment with proper header files and linker scripts**
5. **Automated test runner with smoke test support**

### Outstanding Issues ⚠️

1. **Simulation Runtime Errors:** Tests compile successfully but encounter segmentation faults during execution
2. **Memory Access Debugging:** Need to verify correct memory address mapping and bounds checking
3. **Signature Generation:** Test completion detection and signature extraction require refinement
4. **Test Coverage:** Full conformance suite execution pending resolution of runtime issues

### Error Analysis

The current simulation failures appear to be related to:
- Memory access patterns during test execution
- Potential issues with hex file loading and address translation
- Core reset and initialization sequence
- Test completion detection logic

## Recommendations for Completion

### Immediate Actions

1. **Debug Memory Access:** Add comprehensive logging to identify out-of-bounds memory accesses
2. **Verify Hex Loading:** Ensure test programs are correctly loaded into simulated memory
3. **Core Initialization:** Verify proper reset sequence and initial state
4. **Address Translation:** Confirm correct mapping between RISC-V addresses and simulation memory

### Testing Strategy

1. **Start with Simple Tests:** Begin with basic instruction tests before full suite
2. **Enable Detailed Logging:** Use VCD waveforms and debug outputs for analysis
3. **Incremental Validation:** Test individual components before integration
4. **Reference Comparison:** Compare against Spike simulator behavior

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Performance Optimization:** Optimize simulation speed for large test suites
2. **Coverage Analysis:** Implement detailed test coverage reporting
3. **Continuous Integration:** Automate conformance testing in CI/CD pipeline
4. **Documentation:** Create comprehensive user guides for test execution
