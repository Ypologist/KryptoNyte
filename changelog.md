# 15:50 - Register File Optimizations

**Why these changes were made:**
The multithreaded register file (`RegFileMT2R1WVec`) was previously implemented as a vector of initialized registers. This implementation caused massive physical area usage (due to ~4000 D-flip-flops padding the die) and resulted in severely slow clock frequencies that failed the 100MHz timing target. This was primarily driven by the massive reset fanout required to initialize every bit and the giant combinational multiplexer trees required for the read data paths.

**What the changes are:**
Created a new memory-based version of the multithreaded register file, named `RegFileMT2R1WMem.scala`, with the following architectural optimizations:
* **Memory Primitives**: Replaced the explicit discrete `Vec(RegInit(...))` flip-flops with Chisel's asynchronous `Mem` primitive. This enables synthesis tools (like Yosys) to map the logic to dedicated memory arrays or tighter logic cells instead of standalone standard sequential logic cells.
* **Eliminated Global Reset**: By utilizing `Mem`, the register file drops initialization requirements, resolving severe reset fanout routing congestion. 
* **Hardwired `x0` to Zero**: Added bypass logic ensuring that any thread evaluating a read from `x0` statically returns `0`. Writes targeting `x0` are ignored.
* **Retained Asynchronous Reads**: Maintained combinatorial read ports so that the `TetraNyte` core does not require a new pipeline stage, avoiding new data hazards in its Fetch-Decode-Execute-Writeback pipeline.
